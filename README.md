# ASSIGNMENT #01: Heuristic Evaluation

## Ocean Conservation and Protection in California 
##### _By Vicky Jen| DH110: User Experience and Design_

### About The Project
This project will focus on the 14th Sustainable Development goals of 'Life Below Water' established by the United Nations to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, sea, and marine resources for sustainable development". The project will mainly focus on the act of spreading information and awareness regarding Ocean conservation and protection in a variety of ways specifically in California, United States.  

As a student living in Los Angeles and an International student from Taiwan, I've been surrounded by the ocean my whole life, yet I have never been around it much until this last year. Learning how to surf has made me realize the lack of awareness regarding oceanic issues amongst the general community. However, being in the water constantly to surf, I've been able to see first-hand some effects of oceanic pollution. I want to use this UI project to create a website or mobile app to raise awareness about Oceanic protection to educate the general community on this topic.

### About The Project
In this assignment, I will be conducting a heuristic evaluation through examining the 10 Usability Heuristics of User Interface Designs and Severity Ratings for Usability Problems. The two websites are, Ocean Protection Council and Surfrider Foundation. 

### Website 1 
#####Background Information 
The California Ocean Protection Council (OPC) was created by the California Ocean Protection Act (COPA), to ensure that California maintains healthy, resilient, and productive ocean and coastal ecosystems for the benefit of current and future generations. It mainly provides notes and information on meetings the council holds as well as the latest news.

 #####Heuristic Evaluation 
_Overall Evaluation_: The website has structure and potential to it, however there are multiple missing and nonfunctional links. Many of the important tabs do not function, thus making it very hard for the user to navigate their way through, and gain an understanding of the purpose of this site. Furthermore, the website is also crowded with large chunks of text as well as technical jargon, making it difficult for the user to catch important information.
