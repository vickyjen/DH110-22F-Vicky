# ASSIGNMENT #06: Interface Design
_by Vicky Jen | DH 110: User Experience Design_

### Project Description

This project aims to boost engagement within the surf community in southern california with ocean conservation and protection volunteer events. The project will produce an application that serves as a platform for easier access to information about related events and also connect surfers with one another through similar interests. The purpose of this interface design is to build upon the low-fidelity prototype into an interactive prototype with a fully flushed out design system. This will establish the skeleton of the application for future designs and improvements, as well as allow for better usability testing to gain valuable feedback.
