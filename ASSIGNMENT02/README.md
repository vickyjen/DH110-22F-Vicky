# ASSIGNMENT #02: Pilot Usability Testing
##### _By Vicky Jen| DH110: User Experience and Design_

### Introduction
The California Surfrider website is a platform where users can get information regarding oceanic protection and conservation, donate towards the organization for related causes, and support active campaigns in the California region. The main objectives of the website is to provide updated information and serve as an outlet to help these causes. After conducting a heuristic evaluation on this website, there were some apparent problems: 

1. The website fails to maintain consistency and standards between the nationwide Surfrider website despite being under the same organization. 
2. The website does not match between system and the real world as some categories lack a well-rounded description (specifically legislations and campaigns).
3. The website's flexibility and efficiency of use could be improved by making a more reactive search bar as it does not auto-reccomend keywords or highlight the searched term on the website. 
4. The help and documentation aspect of this website is not severly bad, but could be improved by adding persuasive texts and images on the donate page.   

With these concerns, I will conduct a Usability Test (UT) to understand to what extent the app enhances or hinders the user's ability to complete tasks. The test will focus on the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the California Surfrider website. 

Effectiveness: The completeness and accuracy with which users achieve the task
Efficiency: The resources needed and used in relation to the completeness and accuracy with which users complete the task.
Satisfaction: The comfort and acceptability of use.

In this usability test, I will assign the user three tasks to perform within the website to evaluate. The purpose of a usability test intends to improve a website’s functionality from the user’s perspective. These will be the three tasks assigned:

- Locate the most recent active campaign in California 
- Signup to become an Ocean Friendly Restaurants member
- Find an upcoming beach cleanup to participate in the Los Angeles area to support ocean conservation and protection
