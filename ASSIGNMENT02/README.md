# ASSIGNMENT #02: Pilot Usability Testing
##### _By Vicky Jen| DH110: User Experience and Design_

### Introduction
The California Surfrider website is a platform where users can get information regarding oceanic protection and conservation, donate towards the organization for related causes, and support active campaigns in the California region. The main objectives of the website is to provide updated information and serve as an outlet to help these causes. After conducting a heuristic evaluation on this website, there were some apparent problems: 

1. The website fails to maintain consistency and standards between the nationwide Surfrider website despite being under the same organization. 
2. The website does not match between system and the real world as some categories lack a well-rounded description (specifically legislations and campaigns).
3. The website's flexibility and efficiency of use could be improved by making a more reactive search bar as it does not auto-recommend keywords or highlight the searched term on the website. 
4. The help and documentation aspect, the donation page, of this website is not severely bad, but could be improved by adding persuasive texts and images to encourage the behavior of donating.

With these concerns, I will conduct a Usability Test (UT) to understand to what extent the app enhances or hinders the user's ability to complete tasks. The test will focus on the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the California Surfrider website. 

**Effectiveness**: Accuracy and completeness of how likely users can achieve specified goals

**Efficiency**: The resources expended in relation to the accuracy and the completeness with which users achieve goals


**Satisfaction**: Freedom from discomfort, and positive attitudes towards the use of the product


In this usability test, I will assign the user five tasks to perform within the website to evaluate. The purpose of a usability test intends to improve a website’s functionality from the user’s perspective. These will be the five tasks assigned:

- Locate the most recent active campaign in California 
- Signup to become an Ocean Friendly Restaurants member
- Find an upcoming beach cleanup to participate in the Los Angeles area to support ocean conservation and protection
- Locate the donate page
- Locate campaign AB 2248

### Methodology 
The pilot usability testing took place in my apartment near UCLA located in Westwood (portable minimalistic lab). I will be conducting this test on my macbook pro using the screen recording feature on zoom so the screen will show both me and the user, as well as the actions on my computer. I will start by asking the user for their informed consent, then the pre-test questionnaire to measure the user’s first impressions of the website. Following, the user will attempt five tasks to see how they are able to navigate the website. Then, the post-test questionnaire will measure the user’s experience using the app in terms of ease, time, and likelihood to perform the task again. The System Usability Scale (SUS) will measure the user’s attitude towards the website and its usability. The Product Satisfaction Cards are used to determine how the user feels about the website. This process will take approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete.

## Reflection

Overall, I think the pilot testing was successful and went smoothly. The participant understood the questions asked, and I felt pretty confident going through the test. However, there were a few hiccups throughout the process where the user felt lost, and I felt an urge to help them and give tips. However, I was unsure whether that would skew and bias the answers since this test is meant to see how an inexperienced user interacted with the site. So, I held back my comments and let the user explore on his own. The other issue that came up during the test was invalid links that confused the user even more, but I was able to redirect them to the task and reassure them that it was okay if they could not complete every task. The user was also very good at voicing his thought processes whilst carrying out the tasks, which was very helpful for me to gain insight. From this test, I learned that my expectations for what the user would/would not know is not the most accurate, as the user even found alternative ways to complete the tasks. So, in future UT’s, I would definitely try my best to come up with tasks without assuming how experienced the user will be. Overall, I would say this was a smooth pilot test because it definitely helped that me and the user already had mutual trust, thus moving forward, I will maintain professionalism whilst helping the user feel comfortable in the environment.
