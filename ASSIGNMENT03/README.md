# ASSIGNMENT #02: Contextual Inquiry
##### _By Vicky Jen| DH110: User Experience and Design_

## Step 01: Research goal & requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity this project supports is to boost engagement within oceanic conservation and protection related events in the surf community. This hopes to create a more bonded community in local areas of California with a stronger sense of awareness for environmental issues.

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
Based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, this project will target two different goals:
- Self-actualization: by partaking in acts of community service to benefit the environment, users can realize the potential and power they hold in contributing to something bigger than them. 
- Belonging and love: taking part in these community service events will foster valuable connections with the user’s local surf community and people who share similar passion for surfing and the ocean.  

#### What is (are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to promote engagement with oceanic conservation related community service events mainly rely on social media, donations, or if the user has personal attachments or connections with the particular event. These often are promoted by schools and universities amongst the student population as well by environmental clubs. 

#### What is (are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The current limitations to boosting engagement with oceanic conservation and protection events is due to the lack of information on both the event itself and the cause behind it. With a lack of updated and correct information, it may be hard for interested users to find a way into this community. By improving the website design to be more user friendly and accessible, each local area of California can post area-specific information about events and their oceans, allowing for the people in that area to take part in conserving the oceans they surf in. 

## Step 02: Target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
- Demographic: People, potentially surfers, or anyone who is interested in taking part in community service events related to ocean conservation. 
Preference: Local surfers who go to the ocean often, thus are personally affected by the cleanliness and health of the ocean, and would have the desire to contribute to related causes. 
- Expertise: No expertise required to participate/signup for community service events
- Mainstream vs. extreme: Mainstream surfers of any level 

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
- Where: The users can register and find information about oceanic protection events on the website itself which can be accessed anywhere with a phone, tablet, or computer.
- Why: The conservation levels of the ocean directly impacts surfers as they perform this sport in the ocean. Thus, they would be more inclined to participate in these events which not only boost their self-actualization to bring change to the world, but also help create connections with fellow surfers passionate about this topic, making new friends in a engaged surf community. 

#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
The goal of the users would be to sign up or participate in a real-life event that contributes towards ocean conservation in some form. To do that, they would need to go onto the website and find up to date information about what events are happening around them, and show up to the event itself and participate in it. 

## Step 03: Pick research methods
To get the comprehensive answers on not only what the user thinks about this topic, but also how they feel about it on a deeper level, I chose to conduct a combination of interview and participatory observation. First, I will ask the user some questions regarding their background, then I will ask them their experiences and challenges when faced with community service events for ocean conservation, and finally, I will observe how the user navigates through the tasks. This interview will be conducted in person with screen recording, audio recording, as well as video recording to show the user’s emotions.

### Insights from the Interview

> “Personally, I rely a lot on the ocean as a source of happiness. And I think, so do a lot of people. I think I'm able to empathize with this, because the statistics are very real. And really, you know, they affect everybody, but for like surfers who rely on the ocean for happiness, it really deeply affects us. And if we don't have don't have the ocean or don't have access to clean oceans, that's a big problem, and something that we should really be caring about.”

From this, we can see how the cleanliness and health of the ocean directly affects the surf population, thus the reason for targeting this audience in the project. This also increases the chances of their likelihood to advocate and volunteer for ocean conservation related community service events.

> “For me, community is really important. But at the same time, volunteering it with a new organization can also be scary, like seeing, you know, they have photos on their website like this one we're looking at right now of like a bunch of people that look really happy after a beach cleanup and that like, you know, makes me feel a little bit less scared and like excited to join maybe a new community. And like, you know if these people can do it, so can I.”

Community service is not only for the environment, but also for the community carrying out these actions themselves. Fostering friendships and connections within these groups are key to get volunteers to come back consistently. For the user, seeing evidence, pictures, and videos of successful events is important to encourage them to take action as well. 

> “I've definitely encountered pollution, especially when I've gone surfing in Santa Barbara every time you go surfing you get tar stuck all over you because you know the oil rigs out in the water and Yeah, you get tar stuck all over your feet in your hands. And then like when you're in the water, you can see all the oil film. It’s pretty gross, yeah.”

From a surfer’s first-hand experience, we can see here that ocean pollution is very real and how it directly affects them. Pollution does not just appear as numbers and statistics on paper, but also in their literal forms that can be health hazards to not only the environment, sea-life, but also people. 

> “I think the intimidation factor is very real for a lot of people. And, like, it may sound stupid, you know, like, oh, no, like, I'm afraid to go like, you know, volunteer with people that work for a nonprofit and but I think it is, yeah, very real. And just like, getting involved with a new community, a new group of people can always be scary.”

Here, we learn about a new factor that plays a role in the lack of engagement with community service events. As these are social events, it requires interaction with other volunteers which can be intimidating and scary for some. This shows that it is important to reassure the user about the comfortability and friendly environment that is fostered at a community service event to encourage them to take the first step. 

## Reflection
After completing this interview, I was able to gain insight on some problems that I had previously not anticipated, but also confirm my hypotheses of why there is a lack of engagement in the surf community for ocean conservation related events. Previously, I assumed that there were three main factors, community, the cause, and the organization holding the event. However, I learned that intimidation is a factor too, as community service are social events, so the user would have to interact with other members. It can be scary for the user to go out to a completely new community, thus encouragement, reassurance, and evidence of successful events are crucial to increasing engagement. I was also able to confirm the relationship between ocean pollution and the surf community as they are indeed directly affected. Ultimately, I learned that there is definitely interest in community involvement, but users often need an extra push and reason to take the first step. 

As for the interview and participatory observation itself, it was successful and went smoothly. I conducted the study in a classroom setting with no distractions or disturbances. The interviewee was able to answer the questions well, and complete the tasks as expected. She was not fazed or confused by any part of the interview and is a great example of a target audience in this project. She was also very verbal about the information she was seeing to show the emotions that are associated with environmental issues. However, in future interviews, I would turn on the transcript option on Zoom to ensure a more accurate transcription. Besides that, I would say this was a successful interview overall.
