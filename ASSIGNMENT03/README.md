# ASSIGNMENT #02: Contexual Inquiry
##### _By Vicky Jen| DH110: User Experience and Design_

## Step 01: Research goal & requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity this project supports is to boost engagement within oceanic conservation and protection related events in the surf community. This hopes to create a more bonded community in local areas of California with a stronger sense of awareness for environmental issues.

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
Based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, this project will target two different goals:
- Self-actualization: by partaking in acts of community service to benefit the environment, users can realize the potential and power they hold in contributing to something bigger than them. 
- Belonging and love: taking part in these community service events will foster valuable connections with the user’s local surf community and people who share similar passion for surfing and the ocean.  

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to promote engagement with oceanic conservation related community service events mainly rely on social media, donations, or if the user has personal attachments or connections with the particular event. These often are promoted by schools and universities amongst the student population as well by environmental clubs. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The current limitations to boosting engagement with oceanic conservation and protection events is due to the lack of information on both the event itself and the cause behind it. With a lack of updated and correct information, it may be hard for interested users to find a way into this community. By improving the website design to be more user friendly and accessible, each local area of California can post area-specific information about events and their oceans, allowing for the people in that area to take part in conserving the oceans they surf in. 

## Step 02: Target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
- Demographic: People, potentially surfers, or anyone who is interested in taking part in community service events related to ocean conservation. 
- Preference: Local surfers who go to the ocean often, thus are personally affected by the cleanliness and health of the ocean, and would have the desire to contribute to related causes. 
- Expertise: No expertise required to participate/signup for community service events
Mainstream vs. extreme: Mainstream surfers of any level 

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
Where: The users can register and find information about oceanic protection events on the website itself which can be accessed anywhere with a phone, tablet, or computer.
Why: The conservation levels of the ocean directly impacts surfers as they perform this sport in the ocean. Thus, they would be more inclined to participate in these events which not only boost their self-actualization to bring change to the world, but also help create connections with fellow surfers passionate about this topic, making new friends in a engaged surf community. 

#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
The goal of the users would be to sign up or participate in a real-life event that contributes towards ocean conservation in some form. To do that, they would need to go onto the website and find up to date information about what events are happening around them, and show up to the event itself and participate in it.
