# ASSIGNMENT #02: Contexual Inquiry
##### _By Vicky Jen| DH110: User Experience and Design_

## Step 01: Specify the research goal & requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity this project supports is to boost engagement within oceanic conservation and protection related events in the surf community. This hopes to create a more bonded community in local areas of California with a stronger sense of awareness for environmental issues.

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
The basic need involved for this activity is self-actualization because it is helping users realize the potential and power they have by partaking in acts of community service to benefit the world. It also involves belonging and love because of the community aspect that is fostered when working towards an ultimate goal with people who share the same love for surfing and the ocean. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to promote engagement with oceanic conservation related community service events mainly rely on social media, donations, or if the user has personal attachments or connections with the particular event. These often are promoted by schools and universities amongst the student population as well by environmental clubs. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The current limitations to boosting engagement with oceanic conservation and protection events is due to the lack of information on both the event itself and the cause behind it. With a lack of updated and correct information, it may be hard for interested users to find a way into this community. By improving the website design to be more user friendly and accessible, each local area of California can post area-specific information about events and their oceans, allowing for the people in that area to take part in conserving the oceans they surf in.
