          <p class= >YEW! is a mobile app that aims to boost volunteer engagement within the surf community in Southern California to build a more tight-knit community and 
            stronger sense of awareness regarding ocean conservation. It serves as a platform to not only provide up-to-date information on nearby volunteer events,
            but also bond surfers with one another through similar interests. Personally, I chose to focus on this topic as I picked up surfing over the summer, and was able to experience the effects of ocean pollution first-hand. There were times I surfed and my feet and hands were covered in tar, or pieces of plastic and trash. I have come to learn that surfers are extremely passionate about the ocean and its health, thus I believe they would be the perfect crowd to tackle this problem.   </p>

            Eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from land, yet most of it is invisible to the majority of people. Surfers are a population of people who interact with the ocean frequently and are often directly affected by the effects of ocean pollution. Additionally, as a surfer myself, I have experienced first-hand how my health can be impacted when surfing in polluted waters. This project aims to target the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14, Life Below Water by creating a platform to make volunteering easier and more accessible. Time and convenience are highly valued nowadays, thus by compiling all relevant information related to volunteer events hosted by different organizations, users easily get involved in volunteer communities without feeling confused or intimidated.

                    To understand the current products on the market targeting similar issues, I conducted a heuristic analysis on the <a href="https://california.surfrider.org/">California Surfrider</a>  and <a href="https://www.opc.ca.gov/">The Ocean Protection Council</a> using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Jacob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics</a>. This helped me identify the pain points of users as well as some general challenges when incentivizing users to volunteer for community service events.

                    After this analysis, I conducted a usability test on the California Surfrider website as it was more closely related to my target audience. For this test, I focused on the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction by asking the user to perform five tasks on the website. This activity not only helped me understand how users navigate websites without prior knowledge, but also some challenges that often arise when making the decision to sign up for a volunteer event.

                        To understand and learn more about my target user’s wants and needs without the project parameters. I interviewed a local Californian surfer who has experienced polluted waters before and is passionate and interested in getting involved. She was able to provide niche insights from the user’s perspective such as the intimidation factor when signing up for a volunteer event with a new community. This was able to help me redirect my project’s functions and features towards the user instead of the product.

                            The purpose of UX storytelling is to build empathy by creating realistic stories and scenarios from the user’s point of view. This generates an overall sense of what a potential user could look like, to help get the team on the same page to target pain points and generate solutions. For my project, I made these personas to further understand the way surf communities feel about oceanic protection from different backgrounds.

                          Based on my conclusions from user research, I decided to implement two main features into the application to target the user’s needs.
                          <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                          Feature 1: The main function of the app will be to recommend volunteer opportunities and events based on their location, interests, and time availability.
                          <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                          Feature 2: An additional feature to boost user engagement is a social aspect that allows users to connect with one another through follows, posts, shares, likes, and comments to document the event, and leave user reviews. This feature will keep the users active on the app to stay updated with live information.
                          <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                          I translated these two features into a low fidelity prototype with figma to test out the structure and functionality of the wireflow before implementing a design interface. I designed complete flows without any content to keep the process quick and efficient. Afterwards, I also conducted a usability test with a user where he was able to point out a couple of key elements that disrupted the flow of the features.

                              Before creating the final high fidelity prototype, I created an interface design with multiple iterations to choose the most appropriate aesthetic to match the application. This helped me establish the design system and skeleton for future design and improvements. I explored different typography, layouts, shape variations, and color palettes. Ultimately, I decided on:
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                              Layout: 8 rows, 32px margin, 16px gutter
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                              Typography: Circular STD
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                              Color Palette: White and Teal
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                              Corner radius: 15px
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                              These design choices aimed to keep the interface clean, modern, and sleek to reduce cluttering information that may discourage the user from registering for an event.  
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>

                              Finally, in the final step of this project, I created a high fidelity prototype that integrated the design interface into the low fidelity prototype. This is meant to be a representation of the application itself to be able to conduct effective usability tests with the target users. I designed the prototype on a Iphone 13 Pro Max while paying close attention to UI details, dead ends, as well as the logic of each flow. These are the four tasks that are functional in this prototype: 
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                              1. Login and create a new account
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                              2. Browse and register for an event
                              <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                              3. Create posts, browse social feed, and chat feature

                                    After finishing the interactive prototype, we were also given the opportunity to conduct a brief cognitive walkthrough by asking users that do not know about this product some questions based on appearance and functionality. This was an easy and quick way to gain some feedback about first impressions and future improvements. Here are some key takeaways from the cognitive walkthrough:
Use a form of label to show the user that the even has already been registered 
After registering for an event, return to the original event page instead of the home page to maintain consistency.

                                    This project has shown me the importance of the user’s needs and perspective when creating products. Design should be utilized to enhance user experience, not hinder. Throughout the process, each user research activity was able to lead me to new insights regarding the user’s needs and pain points. These surveys and interviews were able to show me how to pay attention to detail and document every feedback I receive. 
                                    <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                                    The most challenging part of this project was the beginning when I had to really put myself in the user’s shoes to understand what they would want to see in a product. As a designer myself, I’ve been very comfortable creating designs and graphics from my perspective, but to adjust my lens to the user based on the project has been a true learning experience. It was very rewarding to see the final outcome and how the designs are solutions to real problems in this world. 
                                    <div class="row pb-3"></div>
                                    Moving forward, I am excited to take on more projects that target real-world problems and create innovative solutions with the power of UI/UX design to bring change into society.
