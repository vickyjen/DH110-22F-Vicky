# ASSIGNMENT #06: Interface Design
_by Vicky Jen | DH 110: User Experience Design_

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description
This project aims to boost engagement within the surf community in southern california with ocean conservation and protection volunteer events. The project will produce an application that serves as a platform for easier access to information about related events and also connect surfers with one another through similar interests. 

### Purpose of Interactive Prototype
The purpose of this high fidelity interactive prototype is to represent the true application to be able to conduct effective usability tests to the target user groups. It can more accurately collect true human performance data in terms of time it takes to complete tasks, and how the user feels about the overall experience. 

### Process
This high fidelity interactive prototype is developed from the interface design. I created it using Figma with a Iphone 13 Pro Max screen size (428x926px). I used the low-fidelity prototype as a base structure and to determine the flow of each task. Then, I applied the design elements accordingly along with real life events and user personas that were previously created. I focused on creating a comprehensive representation of what the YEW! Application would look like if generated into a product. Paying attention to UI details, dead-ends, as well as common sense and logic. 

## Tasks

Browse and register for an event
